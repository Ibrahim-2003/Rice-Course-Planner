# Rice-Course-Planner
Course Plan Generator

This is a program I made to help me plan out my future courses at Rice University. It calculates how many hours I receive, what requirements are met for my major, degree, and graduation, quantifies the level of rigor of the courses, and helps determine what degrees I can pursue.
