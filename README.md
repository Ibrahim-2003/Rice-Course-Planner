# Rice-Course-Planner
Course Plan Generator

This is a program I made to help me plan out my future courses at Rice University. It calculates how many hours I receive, what requirements are met for my major, degree, and graduation, quantifies the level of rigor of the courses, and helps determine what degrees I can pursue.

`degree_maker.py` is used to generate a LaTeX code which outputs a list of all the courses, course descriptions, prerequisites, hours, and department affiliations and creates pie charts showing the diversity of the courses taken by department. `course_reqs.pdf` is an example output from this program.

`course_planner.py` is used to calculate how many more courses are needed to graduate.
